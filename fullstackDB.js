  'mapquest setting up reduce function': [
    "Trying to set up my reduce for mapQuest, and it's not working how I'm expecting it to. I know I'd need to do something with my new array to get rid of  new opposite directions  but I thought the code below should  at least remoce the redundancies in the first array. From my thinking: reduce is looking at the current value and the previous values, and only if they are not opposites does it add it to the total array. However, I'm getting error messages like the one attached, there is some incrementer thing going on. Would appreciate any guidance!function mapQuest(directions) {  function isOpposite(currentValue, previousValue) {     let valueArray = [previousValue, currentValue]     return valueArray.includes('N' &amp;&amp; 'S') || valueArray.includes('E' &amp;&amp; 'W') }  return directions.reduce(function(total, currentValue, previousValue){             ///if the previous value and the current value are not opposites, only              ///then do we want to add them to the array              if (isOpposite(currentValue, previousValue)) {return total}             else {             total.push(previousValue)             total.push(currentValue)                 return total             }  }, [])  }  Error message: Expected [ 0, 'N', 1, 'N', 2, 'E', 6, 'E', 8, 'N', 9, 'N', 12, 'E' ] to equal [ 'N', 'N', 'W', 'S', 'E' ].",
    "Hi Kevin,The MDN docs will steer you right on this one: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduceNote the third parameter that gets passed to .reduce()'s callback function. It's always going to be the index of the current item in the array that your reduce function is iterating over. So on the first run-through, it's going to be 0, then 1, then 2, etc.  That should get you in the right direction.Now, to get the value of the previous slot in the array, note that the 4th parameter you can pass to reduce's callback will be the source array. So with a call like:  arr.reduce( (total, current, index, sourceArr) // sourceArr is the same as arr  ...you can can reach \"previousValue\" instead using sourceArr[index-1]. Remember to account for edge cases.  -Ziv",
    "Ziv's answer was very helpful for understanding how to access the previous element of the array using reduce.  Additionally, you are going to have issues with your isOpposite function. When you write valueArray.includes('N' &amp;&amp; 'S'), that isn't saying what you think it is. That will actually first evaluate the expression 'N' &amp;&amp; 'S' which will evaluate to true. Then it will see if valueArray.includes(true), which it won't.  In order to properly check if currentValue and previousValue are opposites, you would need to do one of the following:  /* Make sure that both 'N' and 'S' exist in valueArray */ let valueArray = [previousValue, currentValue] ['N','S'].every(dir =&gt; valueArray.includes(dir))  /****** OR ********/ return (previousValue === 'N' &amp;&amp; currentValue === 'S') ||            (previousValue === 'S' &amp;&amp; currentValue === 'N')  /****** OR ********/ const opposites = {     N: 'S',     S: 'N', };  return opposites[previousValue] === currentValue;",

  'using apply with null as an argument': [
    "I'm looking through the documentation regarding the use of .apply(). After reading MDN, I still have some confusion about the appropriate use of null as an argument.The solution code for complement function that reads:  function complement(func) {  return function ( ) {       return !func.apply(null, arguments) }  }",
    "Hey Sara, that's a really good question.  The real use case for .call() and .apply() is to modify the context (this) of a function when it's called and to pass arguments to the function. So, for instance:  function logInfo(age, height) {     console.log(`Name: ${this.name}, Age: ${age}, Height: ${height}`); }  logInfo.call({ name: 'Jimmy' }, 74, 60); // Will log 'Name: Jimmy, Age: 74, Height: 60' logInfo.call({ name: 'Jenny' }, 50, 69); // Will log 'Name: Jenny, Age: 50, Height: 69'  logInfo.apply({ name: 'Jimmy' }, [74, 60]); // Will log 'Name: Jimmy, Age: 74, Height: 60' logInfo.apply({ name: 'Jenny' }, [50, 69]); // Will log 'Name: Jenny, Age: 50, Height: 69'  As you can see, both .call() and .apply() can be used for the same purposes. They both set the context (this) of the function and offer a way to pass additional arguments. The only difference between the two is how additional arguments are passed. With .call(), they are passed as normal arguments, with .apply(), they are passed as an array.  In this next example, it doesn't matter what we pass as the this argument to .call() or .apply() because the function doesn't ever reference a this.  function logInfo(age, height) {     console.log(`Age: ${age}, Height: ${height}`); }  logInfo.call({ name: 'Jimmy' }, 74, 60); // Will log 'Age: 74, Height: 60' logInfo.apply(null, [74, 60]); // Will log 'Age: 74, Height: 60'  So, to finally get around to answering your question...  The function returned from complement just needs a simple way to pass all of its arguments along to func. It does that by hijacking the functionality of .apply(). .apply() is perfect for this scenario because, unlike .call(), it can pass an unlimited number of arguments to the function in a single array (the arguments object). And the reason it passes null as the context (this) is because the func doesn't care what its context (this) is. If the func doesn't ever reference this, then it doesn't matter what is passed at the first argument to .apply(). You could have passed anything there and it wouldn't have made a difference.",

  'question about multiple maps solution spoilers': [
    "struggled with multiple maps for a long time. After looking at the solution, one of the things that was tripping me up was that I was first looping through the array of objects, then doing my for of loop. The solution below has you go right into the for of loop on the second array after you map over the first array. Can someone walk me through what's going on here? It seems to me that they wouldn't be ale to look at the individual objects in the array without first isolating those objects. Basically, it seems to me like we're doing a for of loop over an array, and it shouldn't be able to get at the values we need yet.   Solution:   function multipleMaps(input, maps) {    return input.map(function(key){        for (let map of maps) {            if(key in map) {                return map[key]            }        }        return key    })}",
    "To start with, let's use the examples given in the problem to assert that maps is expecting an array of objects, such as   [   { a: 0 },   { b: 1, c: 2 },   { d: 3 } ]  and inputs is an array of the properties we want to extract from those objects. input will be an array representing keys/properties we want to pull from those objects in map. To think about the solution, I want to clarify that it’s not that you loop the maps array after you map over the first array, it’s while..map() will, in this case, iterate over every item of input, and pass the current item to the callback function declared inside its argument list. In this case, the callback is the anonymous function that begins after .map( and ends on the second-to-last line, and the current item is referenced inside that callback with key.   The for…of is inside the callback function, so it'll be run on every item inside the input array. Remember that these items are all going to be the properties we reference in the objects stored in maps. The loop then runs through each object in maps (e.g., { a: 0} in my example above) and, ifkey` is the name of a property in that object, it returns the value associated with that property. Otherwise, it simply returns the property.  Sorry, that was a lot, but I hope it explains what's going on. Let me know if you have any further questions.",
    "Below is my solution and it passed. One of the things that is confusing me about the TestFirst solution is that the key is being matched but it's not accounting for the fact that there are different types (string and number) in the different test cases. In my solution I needed to turn the value being mapped into a string to account for that and then match it to each property in the object.  const multipleMaps = (arr, maps) =&gt; { return arr.map(val =&gt; { for (let item of maps) {   for (let prop in item) {     if (val.toString() === prop) {       return item[prop];     }   } } });  };",

  'function expressions hoisting best practices': [
    "A quick question about best practices moving forward with es6 syntax - especially when we start creating apps and sites.  Let's say we are making an app and we have 3 functions. The functions call to each other and cascade downwards:  function getRandomUser() {addData()}  function addData(){updateDOM()}  function updateDOM(){  }  In this case we get data on the user, send the user data to the addData function to store it, and then transmit data to appear on the DOM via the updateDOM function.  However, using es6 syntax it would flow in the opposite direction because we can't call function expressions before they are defined as they are not hoisted.  const updateDOM = () =&gt; {  }  const addUser = () =&gt; {updateDOM()}  const getRandomUser = () =&gt; {addData()}  Is this a matter of preference? Is there certain use cases for one over the other? Is it generally best practice to use functions expressions over declarations?   If anyone has any input I'd be curious to hear!",

Point of interest: if we were looking at this.power === \'on\', this would still be OK.

    "Hi Jason.  Nice question - is this example from MDN?  I can comment that the parens surrounding the function allow for the IFFE  to work without an error being thrown.   You probably have this following part down but I'll leave this here anyway.I'm thinking the function (including its code block) is hoisted as expected.  Then within the function's execution context, the 'var x' declaration (but NOT x's assignment) is hoisted.  That's why you get 'undefined' as the value that is being console.logged.   If you comment out var x = 'inner scope' you will see that x becomes 'outer scope' which just shows that the function is looking within its own context first before moving up the so called scope chain.",

The PATH variable is just something that your computer will use to look for executable files. Any executable file that exists in the directories in your PATH variable (delimited by colons) can run without calling the full directory name (e.g. I can run python by typing "python" instead of "/usr/local/python" in my terminal). Whenever you add something to your PATH variable (e.g. export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/bin/npm), you are just adding a new path to the end of the existing PATH variable.  In your .bash_profile, the two export statements are commented out (the # at the start of the line), so that part of the script never runs. You shouldn\'t need to add those lines as part of your bash profile-- you can just run that export command (without the #) from your terminal.',

However, there is also a sub-directory within this one named 'object-syntax-practice', which itself has 'object-syntax.js' and 'object-syntax-specs.js'. They are separate spec and js files, hence why adding a 'dog' object to your code didn't update anything.

Once that if statement is true, that's the end of the recursion, the empty array [[],[]] is returned, and each and every recursive call of that function starts popping off the stack and each return value of that call is pushed into that empty array (which at this point is now labled as multiDimArray).

I have looked at this for a bit and ran the function in the Chrome debugger, and am still not solid on exactly what this line is doing.  if(arr.length === 0) {      return [[],[]];       }  Each expression makes sense to me but not the control flow of the overall function.  This if statement is the end point of the recursive calls which slice the first element off the argument array.  However, the else statement is structured by pushing the elements into either array within the if statement.      const index = number % 2 === 0 ?  0 : 1;     const multiDimArray = evenAndOdd(nextArray);       multiDimArray[index].push(number);  But since the code in the "else" statement seems to be executed before the base case in the "if" statement, it seems like the function is placing elements into the two arrays ("multiDimArray[index]" where index is either 0 or 1) before these two returned arrays are issued from the base case.   The debugger showed the recursive calls slicing the argument array but didn\'t really clarify for me how the elements were then sorted into the arrays that were returned.  Also, relatedly, what would be the benefit of using this recursive solution over an iterative solution?  Is this less expensive?',
    "Let's pass in a simple array of just two numbers, an even one and an odd one: arr = [1,2]. Look through the Chrome debugger how the call stack is formed. everOrOdd() is called 3 times and put on the stack. Let's see why. At the first call, it jumps straight to the else statement and stops at the line where it has to assign to multiDimArray a recursive call to itself. Program execution is halted and everOrOdd() runs again, this time with arr = [2]. It once again stops at multiDimArray and calls itself yet again, with arr = []. Now finally we have our first if case.   Now remember that our two other calls to everOrOdd() haven't finished executing yet. They are both stuck and waiting to assign a value to multiDimArray. Now that it has finally reached the base case it can start assigning values to the multiDimArray variable of each respective call.    The stack looks like this:  everOrOdd([]) -&gt; returns [[],[]] everOrOdd([2]) everOrOdd([1,2])  Once the last call returned to the 2nd call, the stack looks like this:  everOrOdd([2]) -&gt; returns [[2], []] everOrOdd([1,2])  Then like this:  everOrOdd([1,2]) -&gt; returns [[2],[1]] // Final result and final call is popped off the stack  As to your second question, I don't think that there is anything inherently better about doing it recursively in this case (both look like they have a complexity of O(n)), but I think it's just an excercise in training ourselves to be able to solve things recursively when needed since there are cases when iterating will not work (such as when you work with nested arrays). Most if not all things that could be done iteratively could also be done recursively.",
    'Hi Sam,  Awesome! I think you located the source of my confusion, which was the fact that the "else" frames didn\'t complete execution until the recursive calls reached the if statement. So reasoning what you have laid out directly with the code:      const multiDimArray = evenAndOdd(nextArray); // at this point within each frame, control will not proceed to the next lines until the previous frame is returned.      const index = number % 2 === 0 ?  0 : 1; // this actually can be moved below the recursive calls      multiDimArray[index].push(number); // presupposes an array structure which will be returned from the last recursive call  So, from your example, in the second to last recursive call, the logic of the entire frame would look like this:  const evenAndOdd = ([2]) =&gt; {    let nextArray = arr.slice(1); // nextArray = []   let number = arr[0] = 2      if(arr.length === 0) {     return [[],[]]; // this is the next frame   } else {              const multiDimArray = evenAndOdd(nextArray) =  evenAndOdd([]) = [ [ ], [ ] ] ; // here we have the array structure presupposed by the code below       const index = number % 2 === 0 ?  0 : 1;  // index is 0 since its even      multiDimArray[0].push(2);          return multiDimArray; //  the array [ [2] , [ ] ] is then returned into its parent frame at const multiDimArray   } // so, in the next frame, control would resume with const multiDimArray = evenAndOdd([ [2] , [ ] ]), with 1 then pushed to the second array }  More generally, it seems like you have to reason through the call stack "building" as well as the calls stack "resolving" itself, and with complex recursive functions the latter stage is involved in structuring the solution.   By contrast, the other recursive function in the unit is less complex:  function repeat(str, num) {   if(!num) {     return "";   }   else {     return str + repeat(str, num-1)   } }  Here the base case is a blank string, and its role is to merely halt adding additional recursive frames. In the second to last frame, the return would be "str" + "", which would then get added to its parent frame, "strstr," then back up the chain etc etc.  But since string concatenation is built into JS, no extra work needs to be done inside the function in order for the recursive calls to organize themselves during the "resolution" stage, which makes it easier to reason about.',

  'recursion finding base case': [
    "Hi all,  I thought I understood how to find the base case in recursive problems but I still have a question. I thought the question to ask when finding it is, \"how will I know when I'm done?\", and that this usually means coming to the end of the collection. For example, if you have the string 'hello world' and you are making a function called vowelCount, your base case is when you have no string length left (you've iterated through it all). And this seems to be a pattern in recursion problems -- that the base case is an empty string or array or the number zero.  However, let's say you're trying to flatten a bunch of nested arrays using recursion. Is the base case when you've got an empty array (ie, you've come to the end of the array, having flattened everything you could), or is it when you've got a fully flattened array (ie, no element is an array itself?).  Here is a working solution:   function flatten(arr) {   var result = []   arr.forEach(function(element) {     if (!Array.isArray(element)) {       result.push(element)     } else {       result = result.concat(flatten(element))     }   })   return result } flatten([1, [2], [3, [[4]]]]);  It seems like here the base case is when the element is no longer an array. But why is this? Why isn't it an empty array, meaning you've iterated through everything, which would be in keeping with the pattern I've seen is most other recursion problems I've done?  And finally, will every recursion solution include an explicit base case as a rule? Or would the base case sometimes be written at the end in a different way?  Thanks!",
    'Hi Bianca,  This flatten function doesn\'t quite fit the "how will I know when I\'m done" reasoning pattern because it is written as an iteration (the forEach) that makes recursive calls.  In this case the reasoning pattern is "for each element, do I need to call myself?" There isn\'t so much a "base case" as an "I don\'t need to recurse case".  So, yes, you are right, there are different patterns of recursion.  The flatten function could also be thought of as a a "double recursion" on first and rest: concatenate the flatten of the first element of the array with the flatten of the rest of the array,    concat(flatten(arr[0]), flatten(arr.slice(1)))  The we would have two base cases: either we have a non-array, which we wrap up so the caller can concat it, or we have an empty array, which we return, or we concat the flatten of the first element with the flatten of the rest of the array,  function flatten(arr) {     if (!Array.isArray(arr)) { return [arr]; }     if (arr.length === 0)    { return [];    }     return Array.prototype.concat(flatten(arr[0]), flatten(arr.slice(1))); }  A matter of taste? Perhaps a little less efficient because of the extra wrapping up of [arr] in the first line. What do you think?',
    "Hi David,  Thanks for your response! So just to make sure I understand what you're saying: if you're not using an additional method to iterate through your data (like a for-loop, a for-in loop, forEach, map), then you use the \"how will I know when I'm done?\" reasoning pattern, and you state a base case in your code to let it know when it's done.  However, if you ARE using an 'iteration method' in order to search through your data, then you will not actually need to write out an explicit base case in your code (though you could as you do above). It'll actually be simpler to inspect each element and ask, \"do I need to call the function again on this element?\" You want to simplify your data so that you can find the answer to your question, such as, \"are there any html files in this collection of files?\" or, \"are there elements in here for which the function passed in as an argument will return true?\". (Is this the kind of problem that could be solved using 'falsification', or can that be done in both 'types' of recursion problems?)  Let me know if I've understood you correctly. Thanks!",
    "One more question: is it encouraged to NOT use additional iteration methods whenever you can when using recursion? Because isn't the point of recursion to negate/minimize the need for these additional iterations?",
    "With recursion, I like to think of a base case is the very simplest version of the problem. Some problems can have two base cases, depending on the complexity and how you approach the problem.  Let's take in the flatten array function, we know that the end goal is to return an array that is not nested. There are multiple ways to complete this problem, and if you choose to use iteration, there are indeed two base cases. As stated above, one base case is if the array is empty, and the other is if the current element is not an array and need to be looped through traditionally.   Regarding your last question:  One more question: is it encouraged to NOT use additional iteration methods whenever you can when using recursion? Because isn't the point of recursion to negate/minimize the need for these additional iterations?  Absolutely not! Recursion is a useful tool when you don't know exactly when or where you need to stop. In a lot of cases, iteration can much more performant than recursion, because function calls and returns require state preservation and restoration, while iteration simply jumps to another point within a function. It's more complicated than just one is better than the other, see this article, that explains how recursion/loops run in different browsers. http://aaronheckmann.blogspot.com/2010/01/micro-optimization-javascript-recursion.html   Often times, the best way to construct a function is however it makes the most sense to you and if it is readable/maintainable. Right now, you're coding solo, but in the future, you'll be working in pairs at Fullstack and on teams in your job. In that context, it might make more sense to use a loop with/instead of recursion, because your code might be more easily understandable to other people on your team. Just for fun, here's my favorite version of flatten.   function flatten(arr) {   return arr.reduce(function (flat, toFlatten) {     return flat.concat(Array.isArray(toFlatten) ? flatten(toFlatten) : toFlatten);   }, []); }  Hope this helps!",
    "I'd say it is a matter of clarity: use the technique which is easier to read and understand for a given problem.  When working with an array, the iteration functions are probably clearer: especially given the functions map, reduce, some, every, find, and so on.  arrayOfFiles.forEach(file =&gt; mungeFile(file)) arrayOfStudents.every(student =&gt; student.hasSubmittedAssignment)  Recursion shines when the data is structured in some nested fashion: a tree, for example, could be either a leaf, or a pair trees, the left-hand branch and the right-hand branch.     a Leaf: |-----|  a pair of left-branch,   ||            |     |           right-branch. //  \\\\            |-----|                        //    \\\\                                         |---|  |---|                                         |---|  |---|  Let's say each leaf contains a number and we want to sum all the values.  function treeSum(tree) {     if (tree.isLeaf()) {         return tree.value;     } else {        return treeSum(tree.left) + treeSum(tree.right);     } }  You could write that as an iteration, but you'd need to keep track of each branching point and go back - you'd probably keep an array of the parent nodes, like a stack. The recursive version keeps the parents on the call stack for you, so you don't have to do the bookkeeping:  function treeSumIterative(tree) {     let sum = 0     let parents = [tree];     while (parents.length) {        let current = parents.pop();        if (current.isLeaf()) {          sum = sum + current.value;        } else {          parents.push(current.left);          parents.push(current.right);        }     }     return sum; }  That tree is a contrived example; but consider that an HTML document is a tree of nested elements. (Each element can have multiple children, not just two, so we'd probably be back to a mixed iterative-recursive style...)    Hope that helps...!",

This will give you a lot of control over the brackets/curly-braces wrapping as well as the double vs. single quotes.    For #4 - This is definitely a tough one to visualize - we are using recursion, but the base case isn't as clear as with numbers.

You can consider handling one of these simple elements as your base case.  Write out how you would do that first.  Now, if you do have nested arrays or objects, what you would want to do is iterate through your array (I combined the use of a for-loop and recursion for this problem) until you hit one of these nested elements (how can you determine that it's a nested element as opposed to a standard element in your array?).    Then, you would want to treat that nested element as it's own simple array (forget it's nested - just handle it on its own using your base case code).  You will want to concatenate the string value you get from this operation onto the existing string.    Then, you can proceed to the next element in the original array.    Does this make sense?

  'quick question on recursion lesson explanation': [

In the recursion problem, we are given this example  function repeat(str, num) {   if(!num) {     return "";   }   else {     return str + repeat(str, num-1)   } } //repeat(\'hello\', 3) =&gt; \'hellohellohello\'  the function\'s purpose is pretty straightforward, especially when you look at the last line that\'s commented.  The explanation right underneath it then states, "The base case is when num === 0," which makes sense but why is it expressed as: if(!num)? I would have interpreted that as "not a number", and it seems like my google search backs that up as well. Is it synonymous with num===0 in recursion, or something?   thanks!',
    'Hey, seems like they could have used (num === 0) as the base case.   I think they used this so that if one were to submit the function without a repeat value, it will return "".The conditional is taking advantage of the fact that 0 returns false (0 is falsy).',
    'Hi,  You are  confusing a variable name (num) for a data type (number).  Hence you are reading this as not a number when that is not how the compiler would interpret this.  In order to understand what is happening, you need to take a look at the values for number.  As the recursion progresses to deeper levels, the number decreases (in this case from 3) until it is finally 0.  Part of the trick is to understand that logically, any number is considered true while 0 is considered as false.  The ! will cause the variable to provide the boolean value for variable and then negate it.  In this case as long as the value is not zero, it will evaluate to  not true or false.  Once you hit 0 it becomes not false or true.  For this recursion, the if statement could also have been written as   if (0===num) {....}  This is another example of why picking a descriptive variable name is important.  In this case, had the programmer used  "iter" or "copies" you might not have been confused by such a statement as   if(!copies){....}',
    'Hi Seori,   This confused me as well and took me a bit to figure out, but I think it has to do with "coercion" and "truthiness"...I learned about these concepts during the bootcamp prep. Basically, values that are "truthy" are not actually true, but when coerced to boolean (i.e. when used in an if statement) they end up acting true. "Falsey" values are just the opposite.   Zero is a "falsey" value, meaning: if(0) will return false if(!0) will return true   Therefore, in this example, the base case will only run when num === 0 (i.e. when the return is true). So yes, they are synonymous in this case.   Does this make sense? Here\'s some documentation on Truthiness in javascript: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy   I hope this helps!',

Another thing that I have sometimes found helpful with recursive problems is adding an additional parameter. This could be something like passing in a value that you want the function to remember that it wouldn't otherwise. However, the video also says that it's good practice to cut down on extraneous parameters in function calls, so take that with a grain of salt.   Also, I definitely find that using the debugger is an invaluable tool for finding unintentional/incorrect return values. Using the debugger really helps to see exactly what is being sent and returned in the call stack.

To make it work, I had to add some default parameters to the function call.  It causes one of the tests to fail because the number of recursive calls is the nth number in the sequence (10 and not 177).  What I\'m wondering is:  what is "proper" recursion given prior discussion?  Is adding some parameters to keep track of state really ok?  How many is ok?  Or does it really need to be able to get everything it needs from whatever accumulation operation is done via the recursive call?

If we disregard your use of extra parameters then based on these results, I think the fibonacci problem doesn\'t illustrate a good use case for recursion. The iterative version seems to be better.  When it comes to traversing a graph or tree, however, it really makes sense to use recursion over the iterative approach.  Just my two cents.

    "Hi Jeff and Brandon,  That was an excellent idea Jeff! It's such a good idea that it is a common practice in coding called dynamic programming. However, Brandon's approach of storing it in a cache has much stronger applications than passing it through parameters. Imagine if instead of adding the last two numbers, you needed to access even earlier numbers (maybe more than two).   So dynamic programming gives a tradeoff between the amount of calls the program runs and the space in memory we have to use to store the values. This can make some problems actually feasible to do! For instance, take this classic algorithm of counting coins. If you used bland recursion, you would not be able to pass some of the testcases that HackerRank provides, and so you definitely need dynamic programming there.As a sidenote Jeff, it was hard to read your code. I didn't know what p or pp were supposed to do just looking at the function declaration.",

    "Hi All -   I am working on the 08 Recursion part of TestFirst P2, and I just built the type utility function (note: it's not recursive, just in that section).   I got the answer, but I don't really understand why .call effects the code in the way it does.   My question: where var bool = true, why does  console.log(Object.prototype.toString(bool))  return the value --&gt;  [object Object]  But   console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call(bool))  return the value --&gt;  [object Boolean]  It would be especially helpful if someone could point me to where in the .call documentation it alludes to this functionality! I stumbled across the solution through trial and error but am curious how I could have learned of this functionality via the  documentation for call   Thanks!",
    'Hi Annalee,   // where var bool = true  console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call(bool))  // should return --&gt; [object Boolean]  IMHO, the test specs should have included a hint to check out the Object.toString documentation as it contains a section on Using toString() to detect object class',

To use the Object.prototype.toString() with every object, you need to call Function.prototype.call() or Function.prototype.apply() on it, passing the object you want to inspect as the first parameter called thisArg.",

Here:  fib ( 7 ) = ( fib ( 5 ) + fib ( 6 ) )  And when you get to num === 2 or fib(2), your computation is accum + (1 + 0)  So there's no point is going beyond fib(2).",

When your arrays hit the second half of the OR statement it becomes TRUE, an array is not an object according to the type function.  Once you get the array running through the second part you'll need to account for \"[\" \",\" and \"]\". My advice is create an new array where you push all the stringified element into and then when you return that array  return '[' + strArr.join(',') + ']';  That should do the trick.",

    "Play around with this version, see if you can get it to work. This is recursion only for the array. The problem with the recursion in your version was it was hitting an infinite loop, probably when the array became empty.  I added a base case to stop that from happening.  function stringify(input){  if(input.length === 0){    return \"\";  }  if(type(input) === 'String'){    return '\"' + input + '\"';    } else if (type(input) !== 'Array' &amp;&amp; type(input) !== 'Object'){  return String(input);    } else if (type(input) === 'Array'){    return \"[\"+ stringify(input.pop()) + ',' + flattenArray(input) +\"]\";  }}  This still isn't quite right because it isn't adding brackets from multi dimensional arrays. And the commas aren't there either.  If you can allow for loops or forEach, I know this works and uses recursion.  var arrStr = '[';    a.forEach(function(el, i){      arrStr += stringify(el);      if(i !== a.length-1){        arrStr += ','      }    });    arrStr += ']';    return arrStr;",
    "err, actually with pop() the array comes back in a weird order. Same with shift(). I'll keep playing around with it to achieve the solely recursive version.",
    "The problem with stringify is that you have to deal with several differing types of input.  These are objects, arrays, strings etc...  Each of those items (I'm specifically not using a JavaScript data type to verbalize the input), has differing output format requirements.  Therefore, you will need to have a cascading if-else-else-else statement or a case statement to get to the right formatting.  Once you can handle a simple item without nesting, you can start to setup the recursive cases.  If you don't want to use, map, you will have to implement it using a for loop or recursive code.  But remember the definition of recursion does not say you can't use map, but rather is says to keep breaking the problem into smaller parts which can be solved and then the result can be built up using the smaller solutions.  Using map does seem to provide the most succinct, readable, and hence maintainable code.",

It seems like the main difference is that map returns a new array, while forEach works on the original?   if (type(obj) === "Object") { \tvar result = []; \tObject.keys(obj).forEach(function(key){ \t\tvar val = stringify(obj[key]); \t\t\tresult.push(\'"\' + key + \'": \' + val);  \t}); \treturn "{" + result.join(",") + "}";',

    "Hey there! So I need some help breaking down and understanding solution code. So my initial approach was to create something like this:  const extensionSearch = (searchValue, files) =&gt; {      let retVal;      let filterCallback = function(whatGoesHere) {          return whatGoesHere.includes(searchValue);      };      retVal = files.filter(filterCallback);      return retVal;  };  While I believe (I haven't gone back and tested it) that solution would pass now that I changed it a little,  I was failing the last two specs for a long time until I eventually went to the MDN documentation for filter, I followed one of the examples to create this function:  const extensionSearch = (searchValue, files) =&gt; {      return files.filter(function(files) {          return files.includes(searchValue)      })  }  This is the code I used to solve the problem.   But I'm not sure exactly why. I was hoping someone can break down the solution and explain it a little bit. I'm really confused on:  **what the parameter files is supposed to be. I was failing a spec, so I just put in the parameter files, and I started passing. ** the syntax of the second solution.  I also realized I need to review callback functions, and higher order functions to fully understand my solution code. Is there anything else I should look at to understand it better?What was your approach to solving this problem?",
    'Your second solution here works great, but it can definitely be misleading because we have a two different variables in two different scopes both called "files".  A refactored solution might look like this below:  const extensionSearch = (searchValue, files) =&gt; {      return files.filter(function(file) {          return file.includes(searchValue)      })  }  Inside the callback passed to Array.prototype.filter(), we are only looking at one "file" at a time.  This variable is representing a string.  The variable "files" is an array of strings.',
    'When I was a student in foundations, while reviewing higher order functions, I found it very useful to review all of the methods available on Array.prototype.  It is especially useful to know:1) What are the arguments passed to the callback.2) What is returned from the function.3) Does this method edit the original array it is called on?        developer.mozilla.org             Array  The JavaScript Array class is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays; which are high-level, list-like objects.',

I tried to run the first function you coded and a reference error came up for 'whatGoesHere'. When you call .includes on whatGoesHere, javascript is looking for the value stored at the variable whatGoesHere, seeing if it contains the search value, and returning the boolean value of true or false. In your code whatGoesHere was not defined so calling the .includes method would return a reference error. But it you do files.includes(searchValue) you would not get an error because the variable files is defined. It was defined when you first called the extensiveSearch function.  Also, .includes only returns true or false, not the actual value. .filter takes each element in the array and returns a new array of values that passed what ever test you set in you function.    The syntax of the second solution works because the filter function called on the files array, takes each value, sees if it includes the search value and if it returns true passes that value into a new array.  I hope that this was helpful!",
    "Jared_Usher: **what the parameter files is supposed to be. I was failing a spec, so I just put in the parameter files, and I started passing.  @Jared_Usher, regarding that note, I think it is helpful when working on test specs to keep the test specs open along side the solution code you are working on. That way, you can see how the functions you are creating are being called.  In this case, you can see that the extensionSearch function isbeing called with a string parameter as its first param, and an array of filenames as its second param.https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/TestFirst-Part-2/blob/master/07-functional-programming/01-use-array-methods/use-array-methods-specs.js#L80             extensionSearch('txt', [             'hello.txt',             'hello.png',             'hell.csv',             'mlb.txt',             'mls.png',           ])  This is why adding files as a param to your tests helped it pass -- this is simply how the function is being called.",

    "I'm trying to use the Array.every() method and need some help about what's going on / why it isn't working the way I thought it would.  The Rope-Dude assignment specs define a computeGameState() function which is supposed to determine whether all the letters in the secret word have been guessed by the player, at which point setting the gameState property to true.   To determine this, I figured I would loop through every element (character) in the secretWord array, and check if this letter is included within the lettersGuessed array.   if(this.secretWord.every((letter) =&gt; {       console.log('letter is ' + letter);       this.lettersGuessed.includes(letter);     })){       this.gameState = 'won';     }  When this code runs on a game where secretWord = ['t', 'r', 'e', 'e'] and lettersGuessed = ['t', 'x', 'r', 'e'], I've determined that the loop runs once matching the 't' from secretWord[0] to its existence in lettersGuessed, returning true for that instance, but then does not run again. At least, I don't have another round of console.log(). And the total functionality (for the complete run of every(), not just its first iteration) actually returns false. I don't know where this value is coming from, or why it exits out of the loop when 't' returned true.  Below is the same idea implemented with a for loop, and this code works.   const wonState = () =&gt; {       for(let index in this.secretWord){         if(!(this.lettersGuessed.includes(this.secretWord[index]))){           return false;         }       }       return true;     }     if(wonState){       this.gameState = 'won';     }",

Going through my code, I see the third parameter in the reduce() method is a function which takes in 2 parameters, but in the case of the test specs our functions getValue() and isEven() only take in a single parameter. I understand there is an issue here, and I understand that the everyIterator function is checking to see "whether the values up to this point are true and also the current value is true", but I still can\'t fully wrap my head around the step-by-step process of this solution, versus my own.   Thanks!',
    'Did your solution work?',
    '@Mikayla_Toffler I think it might be helpful to think about what that last function parameter in reduce is intended to do. Let\'s call it \'iterator\'Reduce takes an array of items &amp; "reduces" it down to a single return value, by taking the items starting from the beginning of the array, &amp; running them through the iterator one by one. The iterator takes two params, a, the "accumulated value" and b, the current item in the array.This iterator function\'s return value becomes the next iterator\'s a parameter.The last iterator applied on the last item in the array is our "reduced" value, and reduce returns.  every is an application of reduce where we want to know given an array and a function, does that function return true for every item in the array. In this case, it is reducing the array down to a single true or false return value.  So -- think about this case step by step using both your implementation &amp; the solutions\':   const isEven = num =&gt; {    return num % 2 === 0;  }; every([11, 28, 2], isEven); // using the solution: const everySolution = (array, checkerFunc) =&gt; {      const everyIterator = (currentVal, nextVal) =&gt; currentVal &amp;&amp; checkerFunc(nextVal);      return reduce(array, true, everyIterator); } // [11, 28, 2] //  ^ everyIterator(true, 11) // true &amp;&amp; isEven(11) returns false  // [11, 28, 2] //      ^ everyIterator(false, 28) // false &amp;&amp; isEven(28) returns false  // [11, 28, 2] //          ^ everyIterator(false, 2) // false &amp;&amp; isEven(2) returns false  // ^ this is our last run, and our reduce returns false  // using your solution: const every = (array, checkerFunc) =&gt; {      return reduce(array, true, checkerFunc); } every([11, 28, 2], isEven);  // [11, 28, 2] //  ^ isEven(true, 11) // since isEven only takes 1 param, 11 is ignored, the function evaluates as true % 2 === 0  (returns false) // fun fact: true % 2 === 1 and false % 2 === 0  // [11, 28, 2] //      ^ isEven(false, 28) // (28 is ignored again) false % 2 === 0 (returns true)  // [11, 28, 2] //          ^ isEven(true, 2) // true % 2 === 0 (returns false)  Both implementations are returning "false" for every([11, 28, 2], isEven);, but the second is not actually evaluating isEven on the items in the array -- it is just evaluating isEven on our boolean "accumulated value" variable, ping ponging between "true" and "false" each iteration. If the array were [2, 4, 6], we would still get "false" even though every item is indeed even.  It might also be helpful to expand &amp; rewrite the solution for clarity\'s sake:I call the "accumulated value" a verdict because we are expecting just a true or false verdict for the entire array.  const every = (array, checkerFunc) =&gt; {      const everyIterator = (currentVerdict, nextItemInArray) =&gt; {           const nextVerdict = currentVerdict &amp;&amp; checkerFunc(nextItemInArray);           return nextVerdict;      }      return reduce(array, true, everyIterator); }',
    "I'm lost on how the everyIterator function is able to take the nextItemInArray and assign it the next value in the array.",

    "Hi @Emmanuel_Garcia,   Thought I'd take a stab and try to help answer your question.. I'm also stumbling across the problem but rereading what Matt wrote and using his example arrays to visually see it, I think I get whats happening there.. When we created the reduce() function in the prior assessment, reduce() takes in 3 parameters - an array, an initial value, and a callback function.   In Matt's example, everyIterator is the callback function for reduce() and has access the array provided in the every() parameters. The reduce() function takes the array (as the first parameter), iterates through it and feeds it back into everyIterator. everyIterator will use its own callback function which is the checkerFunc to see if the nextItemInArray is true or false . checkerFunc will then return a boolean, and then use that to compare it to the currentVerdict. If  currentVerdict &amp;&amp; (the return value of checked nextItemInArray) is true, return true.  I provided a screenshot of the notes I write as I'm trying to work through the problems.

So, in .map for instance, it would look something like this:  arr.map(function(element, index, arr){     ... code goes here ... })  Reduce breaks from this mold a little bit by accepting 4 parameters. 1) The accumulator 2) The current element in the array, 3) The index of that element in the array, and 4) The array itself. So, you can see that all of the arguments are in the same order as the other Array.prototype methods, but another argument has been introduced to the front of the list: The accumulator.  So, in the example that you gave, currentValue isn't actually an index (like it would be with other Array.prototype methods), it is the current value in the array.

    "Hey, Jonathan!  Your function is returning true/false based upon the first iteration of your loop because of the conditional if/else statement that you have in place. So essentially, when your looping through the first array element, which is '1', you are checking to see if that is equal to the searchedElement, in this case '2'. Your if/else statement is saying, if the array element '1' is equal to the searchedElement '2', then return true, since it is not true, your else statement is returning false within that first iteration, so your loop never finished checking the rest of the array elements for a potential match.  The only refactoring you need to do is drop the else statement within the for loop and only return true within the loop if a match is found, and then place the return false statement at the bottom of your function outside of the for loop as such:  const includes = (array, searchedElement) =&gt; {   for (let i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) {     if (array[i] === searchedElement) {       return true;     }   }   return false; };  That way you can finished iterating over the array!",

If not, the function implicitly returns undefined.  const iterator = (prev, next) =&gt; {     prev &amp;&amp; func(next)  }  You original code above was implicitly returning undefined since you didn't explicitly return anything.  When you remove the curly braces, the next statement will be taken as a return statement.  const iterator = (prev, next) =&gt; prev &amp;&amp; func(next)  The modified code above implicitly returns prev &amp;&amp; func(next). That is why removing the braces magically cured things.  I remember this throwing me off when I was playing around with arrow functions and this is how I understand they work.  The MDN page on arrow functions provide nice examples of their uses:        developer.mozilla.org             Arrow functions  An arrow function expression is a syntactically compact alternative to a regular function expression, although without its own bindings to the this, arguments, super, or new.target keywords.

String.prototype.toUppercase itself is not the callback function passed to map, rather the callback function takes the string and executes toUpperCase on it as a method, placing the new capitalized string in the new array.  Math.sqrt works because sqrt is a method on the Math object (and not on the Number object), and it takes a number as an argument:  console.log(Math.sqrt(25)) // 5console.log(25.sqrt()) // sqrt is not a method on Number Since map passes each array element as the first argument to the callback, Math.sqrt receives a number argument and returns its square root, which will then be placed into the new array, so it works.',

I assume it would then just automatically pass all the arguments to sqrt by default. toUpperCase() on the other hand is a string method, so it needs to be called on that string, not have the string passed to it as an argument. You would need to write a callback that calls toUpperCase() on each element and returns that new string. For example:array.map((element) =&gt; element.toUpperCase());   Hope this helps, I could be wrong in some ways but this is my best understanding of .map from what we've learned so far!",
    "Array.prototype.map DOES pass each individual string to the callback, but String.prototype.toUpperCase() does not take a string argument; in fact, it doesn't take ANY arguments, so it won't work as the callback by itself.  Using Math.sqrt() as the callback, someArray.map(Math.sqrt) is equivalent to someArray.map( e =&gt; Math.sqrt(e)). Math.sqrt takes a number argument and returns the square root of the argument. Since we're passing a number from the original array as an argument and we want the square root returned to the new array being created, Math.sqrt itself can be used as the callback. It fits the pattern we're looking for in our callback.  However, String.prototype.toUpperCase() does NOT take any arguments, so it can't accept the string as an argument, so passing it a string doesn't do anything (except throw an error). It acts on the string for which it is being called as a method. So rather than toUpperCase(string), it must be used like this: string.toUpperCase()  So in our map method, we pass our string into our callback method as an argument, and in the callback method's body we access the string's toUpperCase method using dot notation on the string itself, and return it:  arrayOfStrings.map(e =&gt; e.toUpperCase())  I hope that helps, feel free to reach out if you're still confused ^_^.",
